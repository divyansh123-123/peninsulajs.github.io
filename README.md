## The Website

So you'd like to contribute to the PeninsulaJS site! Thanks for even thinking to :) To work on the site locally, you'll need to do the following:

1. Install [node](http://nodejs.org/), if you don't already have it.
2. Install [npm](https://npmjs.org/), if you don't already have it and it wasn't included with your copy of node.
3. Git clone this repository.
4. Run `npm install` from within the root of the project.
5. `npm run dev` will start up the build process as well as start a local server on `http://localhost:3000`.
6. We use PostCSS to process our styles, so make changes to the CSS files in the `src/` directory instead of `media/`.
7. The site presently does not have a CI process, so commit changed files from both `src/` and `media/`.
